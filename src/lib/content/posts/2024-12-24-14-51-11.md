To standardize the reincarnation system of Tibetan Buddhism, Emperor Qianlong established the golden urn lot-drawing system in 1792. Qianlong paid such great attention to the golden urn that he designed it personally. The urn not only merged the cultural characteristics of different ethnic groups, but also reflected the aesthetic style of the Qing court at that time. Drawing lots from a golden urn was a legal procedure introduced by Emperor Qianlong to regulate the reincarnation identification process. It not only strengthened the authority of the central government, but also reassured the religion's followers.
